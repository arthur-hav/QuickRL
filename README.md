## Install and run

Although it is written in portable format and with a portable library, this 
game have been developped and tested on an Unix host only and have chances not
to work without minor changes on a Windows host. If you are willing to make 
it work for this system but don't have the skill to do it yourself, send a mail
to arthurhavlicek@gmail.com.

Install the SDL library on your system, then run Make on a terminal. You can now
run the game called QuickRL.
